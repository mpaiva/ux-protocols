# UX Protocol for Deaf-Blind Users

## Introduction

- **Objective:** To create digital interfaces that are fully accessible to deaf-blind users, using tactile and other sensory communication methods. This protocol ensures that technology products are usable and inclusive for individuals with combined hearing and visual impairments.
- **Scope:** This protocol focuses on the unique needs of deaf-blind users to provide effective interaction solutions through specialized technologies and adaptations.

## 1. User Personas and Use Cases

- **Development Process:**
  - Engage directly with deaf-blind individuals and organizations that support them to develop comprehensive personas.
  - Collaborate with specialists in tactile communication and assistive technologies.
- **Persona Elements:**
  - **Background:** Diverse backgrounds including the onset of dual-sensory loss.
  - **Disability Type and Severity:** Levels of hearing and vision impairment.
  - **Preferred Technologies:** Tactile devices such as refreshable braille displays, haptic feedback devices, and accessible mobile applications using tactile interfaces.
  - **Goals and Challenges:** Accessing information, communicating with others, and navigating physical and digital spaces independently.

## 2. Recruitment Procedures

- **Outreach Strategies:**
  - Partner with specialized institutions and support groups that cater to the deaf-blind community.
  - Ensure all recruitment and informational materials are available in accessible formats, such as braille or tactile graphics.
- **Inclusion Criteria:** Broad representation of deaf-blind users with varying degrees of sensory impairment.
- **Communication Needs:**
  - Plan for the presence of support persons or interpreters skilled in tactile sign language during sessions.

## 3. Usability Testing Accommodations

- **Accommodation Checklist:**
  - Provide assistive technology that supports both tactile and haptic feedback.
  - Ensure that the testing environment is safe and navigable for deaf-blind participants.
- **Modification Procedures:**
  - Adapt user interfaces to be compatible with braille output devices.
  - Utilize haptic feedback systems for navigation and information retrieval.

## 4. Benchmarking of Tasks and Determining Testing Lengths

- **Task Selection:** Choose tasks that test the efficacy of tactile interfaces and other assistive tools designed for deaf-blind users.
  - Reading digital content through braille displays.
  - Interacting with haptic-based navigation tools.
- **Session Timing:**
  - Allow ample time for task completion given the dual sensory limitations and the use of specialized technologies.

## 5. Testing Environment Readiness

- **Preparation Checklist:**
  - Conduct a thorough accessibility check of both the physical and digital testing environments.
  - Pre-test all tactile and haptic devices for functionality.
- **Environment Setup:**
  - Create a controlled environment that minimizes unnecessary physical and auditory distractions.

## 6. Proposed UX Patterns for Testing

- **Pattern Identification:** Develop and identify UX patterns that effectively incorporate tactile and haptic feedback suitable for deaf-blind users.
- **Implementation Strategies:**
  - Focus on enhancing tactile interfaces that can be used to convey detailed information.
  - Experiment with different intensities and patterns of haptic feedback to optimize user understanding and comfort.
- **Pattern Adaptation:**
  - Refine UX designs based on feedback from deaf-blind users to address any usability issues encountered during testing.

## Additional Considerations

- **Feedback Mechanisms:** Implement tactile-based feedback systems to collect input from participants efficiently.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Continuously adapt and update the usability protocols based on technological advancements and user feedback.
