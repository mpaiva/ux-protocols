# UX Protocol for Individuals with Low Vision

## Introduction

- **Objective:** To enhance digital interfaces for low-vision users, ensuring that all elements are accessible and navigable with the aid of visual aids and technology adaptations.
- **Scope:** This protocol focuses on the unique requirements of individuals with low vision to improve their ability to interact with digital products effectively.

## 1. User Personas and Use Cases

- **Development Process:**
  - Engage low-vision users through interviews and observational studies to understand their interactions with technology.
  - Collaborate with visual impairment specialists and accessibility experts.
- **Persona Elements:**
  - **Background:** Detailed personal and technological usage history.
  - **Disability Type and Severity:** Spectrum of low vision conditions (e.g., partial sight, tunnel vision).
  - **Preferred Technologies:** High-contrast settings, magnification tools, screen readers adjusted for low vision.
  - **Goals and Challenges:** Accessing detailed visual content, managing screen fatigue, customizing interface settings.

## 2. Recruitment Procedures

- **Outreach Strategies:**
  - Connect with community organizations and clinics that support individuals with visual impairments.
  - Utilize platforms that comply with WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) to post study invitations.
- **Inclusion Criteria:** Individuals with a variety of low vision impairments.
- **Communication Needs:**
  - Ensure all communications are accessible, offering large print and high-contrast materials.

## 3. Usability Testing Accommodations

- **Accommodation Checklist:**
  - Provision of adjustable lighting and anti-glare screens.
  - Access to magnification software and high-contrast mode applications.
- **Modification Procedures:**
  - Customize testing setups to facilitate ease of use with magnifiers and contrast adjustments.

## 4. Benchmarking of Tasks and Determining Testing Lengths

- **Task Selection:** Select tasks that challenge visual acuity and interface readability, such as:
  - Reading and interpreting complex visual data.
  - Navigating through high-density informational pages.
- **Session Timing:**
  - Provide ample time for task completion to accommodate visual processing needs.
  - Schedule breaks to minimize eye strain and fatigue.

## 5. Testing Environment Readiness

- **Preparation Checklist:**
  - Verify the functionality of visual aid tools and software.
  - Ensure the physical testing environment is optimized for visibility (e.g., proper lighting, minimal glare).
- **Environment Setup:**
  - Set up stations with options for users to easily adjust screen settings and seating arrangements.

## 6. Proposed UX Patterns for Testing

- **Pattern Identification:** Focus on UX patterns that support visibility enhancements, such as scalable fonts and adaptable color schemes.
- **Implementation Strategies:**
  - Ensure all interface elements are compatible with adaptive zoom and customizable contrast settings.
  - Implement clear and distinct auditory feedback where appropriate.
- **Pattern Adaptation:**
  - Modify UX patterns based on iterative feedback to fine-tune visual and navigational aids.

## Additional Considerations

- **Feedback Mechanisms:** Employ multiple feedback formats, including verbal feedback and accessibility-focused user surveys.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Use feedback to continuously improve interface designs, focusing on ease of access and minimizing visual clutter.
