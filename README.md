# Inclusive UX Protocols for Usability Studies

Welcome to the repository of Inclusive UX Protocols, a comprehensive collection of guidelines designed to enhance usability studies by incorporating the needs of diverse user groups. This collection aims to ensure that digital products are accessible and user-friendly for everyone, regardless of their abilities or circumstances.

## About the Protocols

These protocols provide a structured approach to conducting usability studies that are inclusive of individuals with various disabilities and backgrounds. Each protocol is tailored to specific user needs, promoting empathy and understanding in UX design.


## Disclaimer
These protocols are for guidance only and are continuously improved with community feedback and expert contributions. We invite all interested parties—researchers, designers, advocates, and users themselves—to share their experiences, suggest modifications, and propose new user groups. Your input will help us ensure that our protocols are comprehensive, up-to-date, and truly reflective of the needs of all users. Together, we can create more inclusive digital environments that cater to everyone's needs.


### Objective

The purpose of these usability studies is to develop products that are accessible to all, emphasizing the importance of inclusivity. These protocols help identify and overcome potential barriers in product interaction that different groups might face.

### How we employ AI assistance

Our [UX Protocol Template](/uxp-template.md) was meticulously crafted by experienced UX professionals. To enhance the comprehensiveness and effectiveness of these protocols, we have employed the assistance of artificial intelligence to generate plain language insights. By combining human expertise with advanced technology, we aim to foster greater innovation and inclusivity in UX design. 

We are committed to transparency in our development process and openly acknowledge the role of artificial intelligence in shaping these protocols. Alongside AI contributions, we ensure that all content undergoes thorough human reviews to maintain ethical standards and relevance to real-world applications. This balanced approach guarantees that our methodologies are not only innovative but also ethically sound and practically effective.

### Scope

## Protocol Structure

Each protocol includes the following sections:

1. **User Personas and Use Cases**
   - Development through interviews and collaboration with advocates.
   - Detailed persona elements including background, technology preferences, and challenges.

2. **Recruitment Procedures**
   - Ethical outreach strategies and inclusion criteria.
   - Communication needs for diverse languages and abilities.

3. **Usability Testing Accommodations**
   - Comprehensive accommodation checklists and modification procedures.

4. **Benchmarking of Tasks and Determining Testing Lengths**
   - Selection of relevant tasks and scheduling to accommodate fatigue and attention spans.

5. **Testing Environment Readiness**
   - Preparation checklists and environment setup details.

6. **Proposed UX Patterns for Testing**
   - Identification and implementation of effective UX patterns.
   - Adaptation of these patterns to meet diverse needs.

## Additional Resources

- **Feedback Mechanisms:** Ensuring all participants can provide valuable insights into the usability process.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Regular updates to the protocols based on participant feedback and new research.
- **Appendix:** Includes a glossary and a comprehensive list of resources and contacts for further assistance.
